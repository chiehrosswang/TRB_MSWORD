# TRB_MSWORD
This repository contains MS Word templates for preparing TRB peer review papers.  Two versions are provided for different users depending on their intended use:

1. Lite version (.dotx): this version requires user to manually type in the total number of figures and tables, which is a field object, and it automatically calculates total word count when the document is updated (press Ctrl+A to Select All then press F9 to update)

2. Macro-enabled version (.dotm): this version enables a simple macro (NumFigTab.bas) that automatically calculates total word count when the hotket combination (Alt+C) is pressed.  Note that the user has to set up table and figure captions to the correct style (Caption) for the figure/table count to work properly.  To set up caption style, select the entire caption of a figure/table, go to the Home tab, in Styles, select Caption to apply the style.  Once all captions are set up correctly, press Atl+C to automatically update the document and count the total word count.
